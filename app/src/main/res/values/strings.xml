        Another feature in the developer options helps you identify overdraw by color-coding your UI.
        Overdraw occurs when your app draws the same pixel more than once within the same frame.
        So this visualization shows where your app might be doing more rendering work than necessary,
        which can be a performance problem due to extra GPU effort to render pixels that won’t be visible to the user.
        GPU overdraw problem can occur because of the nesting of layout, so we need to solve that problem by reducing the nesting level.
        Following are the steps to enable GPU overdraw in your device.
    On your device, go to Settings and tap Developer Options.
